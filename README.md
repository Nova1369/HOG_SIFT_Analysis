1.
Extract deep features from the pre trained VGG 16 model and extract hand crafted
Histogram Oriented Gradient HOG features for MNIST dataset Stack the deep
features with HOG features and model it using a random forest classifier to classify
the MNIST dataset. Run the hybrid model 5 times and compute the mean accuracy.

Extract deep features from the pre trained VGG 16 model and extract hand crafted
SIFT and HOG features for MNIST dataset Stack the deep features with HOG and
SIFT features and use PCA to transform and reduce the dimension Test using
different component values Model the transformed features using a random forest
classifier to classify the MNIST dataset. Run the hybrid model 5 times and compute
the mean accuracy.
